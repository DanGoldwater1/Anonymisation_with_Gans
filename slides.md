- Definition from [NHSX AI dictionary](https://nhsx.github.io/ai-dictionary?term=anonymisation)

- Fundamental law of information recovery: if we can query source mulriple times and it returns accurate information for each query, the underlying data can be reconstructed in full.

Aim to minimize probability of successful de-anonymization
